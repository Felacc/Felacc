Hello! I am Information and Computer Systems student in my second year.

On my GitHub you will find repositories that contain various projects I have completed both at school and on my own time (either for extra-curricular courses or just out of passion).

The projects you will find on my GitHub are mostly going to be related to full-stack Java application development, and full-stack JavaScript web development.

<!---
Felacc/Felacc is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
